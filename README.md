# Zerhacker
The "Zerhacker" is a machine for automatically cutting SMD Strips.

##Features
- Can pull strips by a defined number of parts
- Automatically corrects drift caused by stepper being unable to turn the exact value needed

##ToDo
- commentary
- make code more efficient (drift counter with bresenham-algorithm?)
- make a button for safe shutdown (so that the motors are in a defined state for shutdown)
